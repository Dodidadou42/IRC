The point of the IRC project is to create our own IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, which can interact with real IRC clients. This project requires implementing the client-server architecture using TCP/IP protocols. The program must handle multiple connections simultaneously through the use of non-blocking sockets or select/poll mechanisms, manage user and channel data, and ensure that messages are properly routed between users and channels according to IRC protocol specifications. This project offers practical experience with network programming, concurrency, and application protocol implementation.


Technologies used: C, sockets, TCP/IP, server architecture.

Key skills developed: Network programming, concurrency handling, protocol implementation, and real-time communication management.
